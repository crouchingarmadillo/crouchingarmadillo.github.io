I am a computer scientist who likes to have fun with math and physics. I love anything and everything about these subjects. This blog will be a fun place where I share my thoughts on cool stuff I find or just want to share in general. I hope all the readers enjoy themselves here :). This site was created with [Jekyll Now](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now).

### More Information

My more specific interests are in algebraic geometry, computational complexity, and anything quantum.
